\header{Projects}
{\textbf{Academic Mini Project - Design and analysis of a Pneumatic Forklift, CMRCET, 2016}}\\
Designed a rudimentary model of a pneumatic forklift using Creo Parametric 3.0. Performed static analysis of said model with standard load conditions using ANSYS 16\\

{\textbf{Final Academic Project - Performance analysis of Coated Single Point Cutting Tools in Turning Operation, CMRCET, 2017}}\\
The objective was to analyze cutting parameters like depth of cut, feed rate and cutting speed of a single point cutting tool during turning operation. Three tools were used: a CVD coated carbide insert, Nickel coated carbide insert and an uncoated carbide insert. Effect of changes to cutting parameters and tool coating was determined by measuring the surface roughness\\

{\textbf{CAD Design Project - Suspension system of an All Terrain Vehicle, UIC, 2019}}\\
A group project involving the CAD modelling of the suspension system of an all terrain vehicle. Focus of the project was the design of the wheel hub. Auxiliary components such as knuckle, shock absorber, wishbones, brake calliper and disk were modelled as well. ANSYS topology optimization was used to improve the wheel hub design by removing unnecessary material.\\
